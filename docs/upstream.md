Upstream disturbance are calculated using the hydrological connectivity between neighboring catchments and the disturbance footprint generated by the intacness map. 

The **upstream area disturbed (sq km)** is calculated for each catchment by summing the area of the disturbance footprint intersecting the respective upstream catchments. 

The **upstream percent disturbed** represent the percent of the area being disturbed within the entire upstream area. 

A catchment located downstream will end up with a high value of area being disturbed while it could potentially have a low percent value being disturbed related to the total area being upstream.
